<p>Hey there! I'm a coffee-fueled multitasker who overthinks everything, lives for good memes, and believes Wi-Fi is life. I’m equal parts curious and chaotic, always trying to “debug” my own plans, and ready to debate the weird combo of pickles and peanut butter—just to keep things interes</p>

I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can collaborate with innovative teams, learn from industry leaders, and drive impactful projects. Let's connect and explore how we can create something exceptional together!.</p>
